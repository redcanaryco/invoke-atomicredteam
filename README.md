Invoke-AtomicRedTeam is a PowerShell module to execute tests as defined in the [atomics folder](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/tree/master/atomics) of Red Canary's Atomic Red Team project. 
The "atomics folder" contains contains a folder for each Technique defined by the [MITRE ATT&CK™ Framework](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/). 
Inside of each of these folders you'll find a **yaml** file that defines the attack procedures for each atomic test as well as an easier to read markdown (**md**) version of the same data.
